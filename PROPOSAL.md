# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Helen Mancini and Adrian Turkedjiev

# Intentions:

LOLCODE (esoteric internet meme language) to Python translator and interpretor. 

# Intended usage:

This translator is intended to deobfuscate code from an esoteric language, LOLCODE, into runnable Python code. 

# Technical Details:

This project will entail breaking down LOLCODE into syntax trees and using them to peice code back together as Python.

Topics from class: Esoteric coding languages, code Obfuscation/Deobfuscation, make recipe/bash scripts

Helen will do research and work primarily on writing LOLCODE and breaking down LOLCODE into syntax trees.

Adrian will do research and work primarily on translating syntax trees of code in Python.

    
# Intended pacing:

Week 1: Researching LOLCODE, finding updated syntax, putting together documentation note, planning and beginning implementation (ei figuring out syntax tree structure)

Week 2: Complete implementation of parsing LOLCODE and translating it

Extra Time: Writing LOLCODE testers, debugging, presentation
