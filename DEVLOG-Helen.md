### 2025-05-15 - Cloned repo, began research on esolang LOLCAT, made plan
Decided between esoteric coding languages, decided to begin coding a language interpreter for a subset of python (print statements, while loops, conditionals, vars, arithmatic etc...). 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE
- https://gist.github.com/sharmaeklavya2/8a0e2581baf969be0f64
  
We also made codeplan.txt and outlined our plan for coding the interpreter.
