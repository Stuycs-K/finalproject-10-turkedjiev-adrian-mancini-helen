# LOLCODE DOCUMENTATION

## Comments: 

“BTW …”

OR multi-line:  “OBTW…
…TLDR”

## File creation:

“HAI…
…KTHXBYE”

## Variables:

All are local to enclosing function or code block 

Variable identifiers may be in all uppercase or lowercase letters (or a mixture of the two). They must begin with a letter and may be followed only by other letters, numbers, and underscores. No spaces, dashes, or other symbols are allowed. Variable identifiers are CASE SENSITIVE – "cheezburger", "CheezBurger" and "CHEEZBURGER" would all be different variables.

Declare: 
“I HAS A … “
“I HAS A <var> ITZ <val>”
“<variable> R <value>”

## Types:
strings (YARN), 
integers (NUMBR), 
floats (NUMBAR), and b
booleans (TROOF) 
* The two boolean (TROOF) values are WIN (true) and FAIL (false). The empty string (""), an empty array, and numerical zero are all cast to FAIL. All other values evaluate to WIN.
* 
- 
Until a variable is given an initial value, it is untyped (NOOB)

## Math:

SUM OF <x> AN <y>       BTW +
DIFF OF <x> AN <y>      BTW -
PRODUKT OF <x> AN <y>   BTW *
QUOSHUNT OF <x> AN <y>  BTW /
MOD OF <x> AN <y>       BTW modulo
BIGGR OF <x> AN <y>     BTW max
SMALLR OF <x> AN <y>    BTW min
